## Program Notes
Rap Song n+1 is a piece with a randomly generated instrumental and vocals. Five parts of the drum beat are created using a Markov Process, which include the hi-hat, kick, snare, clap, and “hey”. The Markov Process is designed to emulate a typical rap beat, with each newly generated instrumental taking 4 measures. The piano is implemented by playing random notes using the Koenig algorithm, switching between A minor and E major (a typical rap chord progression). For all instrumental parts, a “goHard” parameter is passed into the algorithm which, if true, creates more variation in the instrumental. The bassline was tuned by me to fit the rest of the instrumentals. The vocals are taken from a vocal-isolated version of Lil Baby and Drake's “Yes Indeed”. Each line was sliced and randomly inserted back into the song using a separate Markov Process, giving preference to lines that I personally found amusing. The piece serves as a commentary on the lack of innovation in the Hip Hop genre, as well as highlighting the lack of importance of cohesive lyrics.
